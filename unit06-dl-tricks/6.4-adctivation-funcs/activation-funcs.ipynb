    "# Reasons Why Sigmoid Activation Function is Considered Slow\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement that sigmoid activation function is \"slow\" refers to its computational inefficiency, particularly during the training phase of neural networks. There are a few reasons why sigmoid activation can be slower compared to other activation functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exponential calculations: The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, involves computing exponential values. The formula for sigmoid activation is given by Ïƒ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)), where e represents Euler's number (approximately 2.71828). Computing exponentials can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large matrices or deep neural networks with many parameters. This slows down the overall training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limited range: The sigmoid function maps the input values to a range between 0 and 1. As a result, it tends to squeeze the activations towards the extremes of this range (0 or 1) for inputs with large magnitudes. This phenomenon is called \"saturation.\" When the activations are saturated, the gradients become very small, leading to the vanishing gradient problem. This can hinder the learning process, making it slower and more challenging for the network to converge.\n",
    "#### Symmetry breaking problem: Sigmoid functions suffer from a symmetry problem during the backpropagation algorithm. Due to the derivative of the sigmoid function being in the range of 0 to 0.25, if the weights are initialized symmetrically (e.g., to zero or small random values), the gradients computed during backpropagation will be identical for all neurons. This symmetry can cause problems, preventing neurons from learning diverse features and limiting the network's representational capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To address these issues, other activation functions such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants have gained popularity in recent years. ReLU is computationally efficient, avoids saturation for positive inputs, and helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem to some extent. It has become the default choice for many neural network architectures due to its superior performance and faster convergence."
